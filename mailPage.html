                Shakira, who is in her early forties, corralled her fam ily: her
                husband, an opium merchant, who was fast asleep, having
                succumbed to the temptations of his product, and her eight
                children, including her oldest, twenty-year-old Nilofar—as old
                as the war itself—whom Shakira called her “deputy,” because she
                helped care for the younger ones. The family crossed an old
                footbridge spanning a canal, then snaked their way through reeds
                and irregular plots of beans and onions, past dark and vacant
                houses. Their neighbors had been warned, too, and, except for
                wandering chickens and orphaned cattle, the village was empty.
                Shakira’s family walked for hours under a blazing sun. She
                started to feel the rattle of distant thuds, and saw people
                streaming from riverside villages: men bending low beneath
                bundles stuffed with all that they could not bear to leave
                behind, women walking as quickly as their burqas allowed. The
                pounding of artillery filled the air, announcing the start of a
                Taliban assault on an Afghan Army outpost. Shakira balanced her
                youngest child, a two-year-old daughter, on her hip as the sky
                flashed and thundered. By nightfall, they had come upon the
                valley’s central market. The corrugated-iron storefronts had
                largely been destroyed during the war. Shakira found a one-room
                shop with an intact roof, and her family settled in for the
                night. For the children, she produced a set of cloth dolls—one
                of a number of distractions that she’d cultivated during the
                years of fleeing battle. As she held the figures in the light of
                a match, the earth shook. Around dawn, Shakira stepped outside,
                and saw that a few dozen families had taken shelter in the
                abandoned market. It had once been the most thriving bazaar in
                northern Helmand, with shopkeepers weighing saffron and cumin on
                scales, carts loaded with women’s gowns, and storefronts
                dedicated to selling opium. Now stray pillars jutted upward, and
                the air smelled of decaying animal remains and burning plastic.
                In the distance, the earth suddenly exploded in fountains of
                dirt. Helicopters from the Afghan Army buzzed overhead, and the
                families hid behind the shops, considering their next move.
                There was fighting along the stone ramparts to the north and the
                riverbank to the west. To the east was red-sand desert as far as
                Shakira could see. The only option was to head south, toward the
                leafy city of Lashkar Gah, which remained under the control of
